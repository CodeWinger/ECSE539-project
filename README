this is an interesting project. go for it!

however, i would like to know a bit more about the scope of the project
and which modeling/programming tools you are going to to be using.

since you are going to model textual programming languages, you may want
to consider using xtext (https://eclipse.org/Xtext/index.html) to specify
both the source and target language. we will be going over xtext in the
course in the tutorial on nov09. the xtext website has excellent tutorials
for you to look at before then and get started earlier.

xtext operates on top of the EMF framework, which we will be discussing
over the next two weeks in the course. to learn more about this
integration, see
https://eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/308_emf_integration.html#model-metamodel.
in a nutshell, xtext uses EMF's ecore to define the metamodel of your
language. you may then use a transformation engine (e.g., ATL) that works
on ecore models to transform your source to your target model.

in essence, you will use xtext to create a program in your source language
and you can then save it in txt form (to be viewed by the user) and as an
ecore XML file. you then define transformations (e.g., with ATL) based on
the ecore representation of the source language to the ecore
representation of the target language. the ecore XML file of the target
language is then loaded with xtext (because it understands the ecore
specification) and visualized as text.

this way the project will allow you to get to know better key technologies
in the software language engineering domain. let me know what you think.

in any case, the next step is to define the metamodel for your source and
target languages. try to do this sooner than later and then meet with me
or email me to discuss your metamodels.
